# VLA (Vision-Language-Action)

## Module Overview

Integrating vision, language, and action for intelligent robot behaviors. This module combines perception, natural language understanding, and action execution to create systems that respond to voice commands.

### Focus and Theme: *Natural human-robot interaction through voice and visual understanding*

### Goal: *Students implement systems that understand and respond to natural language commands while perceiving and acting in their environment*
