# CAPSTONE

## Module Overview

The integrative module that brings together all previous modules into a complete, functional humanoid robot project. This module demonstrates the synthesis of all learned concepts into a working system.

### Focus and Theme: *Complete system integration of all robotics capabilities into a functional humanoid*

### Goal: *Students implement and demonstrate a complete AI-powered humanoid robot that integrates all previous modules*

## CONTENT
