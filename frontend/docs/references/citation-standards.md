# Citation Standards and Bibliography Template

This document outlines the citation standards required for the AI Robotics Textbook, ensuring at least 50% of references are peer-reviewed publications, official SDK/API documentation, or authoritative textbooks.

## Citation Standards

The textbook must maintain its academic and technical credibility by following these citation guidelines:

### Required Citation Categories (Must Comprise 50%+ of All Citations)

#### 1. Peer-Reviewed Publications
- Journal articles published in peer-reviewed venues
- Conference papers presented at top-tier robotics/AI conferences
- Workshop papers that underwent peer review
- Academic theses and dissertations

**Examples:**
- Articles from IEEE Transactions on Robotics
- Papers from ICRA (International Conference on Robotics and Automation)
- Publications in the International Journal of Robotics Research

#### 2. Official SDK/API Documentation
- Technical documentation from official developers
- API reference guides
- Official tutorials and guides from technology creators
- Technical specifications and standards

**Examples:**
- ROS 2 official documentation
- NVIDIA Isaac SDK documentation
- Unity Robotics Framework documentation
- OpenAI Whisper documentation

#### 3. Authoritative Textbooks
- Established textbooks in robotics, AI, and related fields
- Academic texts published by reputable publishers
- References recognized as definitive in the field

**Examples:**
- "Probabilistic Robotics" by Thrun, Burgard, and Fox
- "Introduction to Robotics" by Craig
- "Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control" by Siciliano and Khatib

### Acceptable Secondary Citations (Up to 50% of All Citations)

#### 1. Technical Reports
- Whitepapers from technology companies
- Research reports from institutions
- Technical documentation from organizations

#### 2. Preprints and ArXiv Papers
- Preprint manuscripts on arXiv
- Research papers awaiting peer review
- Technical reports from academic institutions

#### 3. Online Resources
- Official blog posts from technology companies
- Verified YouTube tutorials from experts
- Documentation from reputable open-source projects

## Verification Checklist

To ensure compliance with the 50%+ requirement, verify the following:

- [ ] Count peer-reviewed publications, official documentation, and authoritative textbooks
- [ ] Ensure this count represents at least 50% of total citations
- [ ] Verify each citation includes appropriate publication details
- [ ] Confirm all cited sources are accessible and current
- [ ] Validate that sources support the technical claims made

## Process for Adding Citations

1. Identify claim that requires citation
2. Find the most authoritative source for the information
3. Determine if the source fits in the "required" category (peer-reviewed, official doc, authoritative textbook)
4. If not, limit the number of secondary sources to maintain the 50%+ requirement
5. Format the citation according to APA style
6. Add to appropriate section of the module's bibliography

## Maintaining the 50% Requirement

1. Regularly audit the bibliography of each module
2. Ensure new citations maintain the required ratio
3. Update citations when official documentation is superseded
4. Verify that URLs and access dates remain current
5. Seek peer-reviewed alternatives when adding new secondary sources

This citation framework ensures the textbook meets the success criteria of maintaining at least 50% peer-reviewed or official documentation while providing a comprehensive and credible reference base.
