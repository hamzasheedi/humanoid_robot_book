# ADR-008: Citation and Formatting Style

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-12-08  
**Author**: Qwen Code

## Context

The AI Robotics Textbook must maintain academic credibility and adhere to the project constitution's requirement of minimum 50% peer-reviewed or official documentation citations. A consistent citation style is required for academic integrity, reproducibility of references, and to meet the project's quality standards. The chosen style must be appropriate for technical and academic sources while being familiar to the target audience.

## Decision

We will use APA-style citations throughout the textbook. All research notes, outlines, drafts, and final content must embed citations in APA format. This decision is reinforced by the project constitution which mandates APA or IEEE style, with APA being more familiar to the target audience of high school and early college students.

## Consequences

Positive:
- Maintains academic credibility and meets constitution requirements
- Provides clarity and standard academic format for readers
- Compatible with technical and code-centric references
- Consistent with educational literature familiar to target audience
- Supports the 50% peer-reviewed citation requirement efficiently

Negative/Risks:
- All tasks producing research notes, outlines, or drafts must embed citations in APA
- Verification of proper citations occurs during quality checks
- Team members need to be familiar with APA citation format
- May require additional tools or plugins for citation management
- Potential complexity for citing code repositories and technical documentation

## Alternatives Considered

- **IEEE style**: More familiar in engineering contexts but less familiar to general readers. Rejected due to lower familiarity for target audience.

- **Chicago Manual of Style**: Comprehensive but less suited for technical and academic sources in robotics field. Rejected due to mismatch with technical focus.

- **APA style** (selected): Provides clarity, standard academic format, and is compatible with code-centric references.
